		2.4	of course the apparent relative sizes of the sun and moon are coincidental.	as a matter of fact, yes, it is only a coincidence.
		0.8	my opinion is to wait for the child to ask for it.	i really wanted my ears pierced, but my parents said i had to wait until i was 10 years old.

		1.2	another example of the same combination of gnarly syllable structure and tone is tlingit, where words like [tʃχánkʼ] ‘grandkid’ and [ɬʔùɬ.tʃí.nì] ‘vest’ occur.	i think that the basic observation about agglutinative languages generally not having complex tonal systems is pretty well upheld.
		0.4	the answers provided to this question so far seem to be good.	you could confirm with taking an image of the star trails.
		1.2	in the fall dig the peony and the rose out.	peonies are often shipped by nurseries as root stock, and they can be propagated from toot cuttings (which you've found!

		3.4	nor have i seen any proof that those who are associated with the so-called ground zero mosque were in anyway associated with the murderers of 9/11.	i do not recall anyone suggesting that those behind the ground zero mosque were to be held accountable for 9/11.
		0	so if the kids don't kill themselves they end up in jail and it's every ones fault other than their own.	i don't ever try to pass anything off as being other than it is.
		0.333333333333333	that, of course, is just my opinion.	the whole country is a toxic cesspool of pollution.
		0	he is an ex-ecb vice president.	this was an accident...
		0	other than you, of course.	this is of course, upsetting.
		0	i would i struggle to meet my iva monthly payments and my mortgage payments when i don't have a tenant paying me.	so i offered to make whatever she didn't want to, and at first she didn't want me to have to make anything.
		0	soaring food prices/ fuel...	as part of the process, fine.

		0	therefore it can only apply to a species/population.	what a bloody disgrace of a situation.
		0	it was bemusing to many here how deeply ingrained the open racism still is in some communities of the usa.	hello i was wondering if anyone has been having problems with paying for childcare using evouchers with computershare.
		0	i don't spend my days surfing for news bytes to find something to bitch about.	i don't mean for president; i mean out of the country.
		0	every single person who is assuming zimmerman should be in jail just because the kid he shot was black.	my sister is two years younger than i am, and i remember the day she came home from the hospital.
		0	she actually asked me if i had a can of pumpkin for back up.	she acts like she had no idea who she was praising.
